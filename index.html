      How to Clean Water Sustainablly in Africa. 
      </p>
    <p class="paragraph2"> Our project reaserched the possibillity of using plants to filter water in African rivers. 
      We chose this topic because most water filtration sytems are temporary and use harsh chemicals.
      We wanted to find a way to create permanent solutions without destroying the enviornment. </p>

  What’s Wrong    
      <br/>
      The biggest water pollutant in African rivers is wastewater and all the toxins that come with it. This 
      problem is very large and complicated. Most villages water supplies depend on rivers for there refillment. On any given 
      river there are several villages and they all drink and use the water from the river. Most of the rainwater flows into 
      these rivers and collects there. Most people in the villages assume that the water will simply flow away and never be 
      seen by anyone ever again. But they are wrong, one village might get their cattle to drink from the river another village 
      further downstream will wash their cloths in the river and by the time it reaches the third village it is dirty and 
      contaminated.  Many people don’t know about this problem and don’t realize that they’re creating it. The toxins in the 
      water are very similar between different rivers and places, they usually include, ammonia, household chemicals such as 
      soap and cleaning solutions, organic contaminants, and different wastewater such as garbage and waste water. Ways to tell 
      if the water is clean or not is by the pH level, the colour of the water, measure what microorganisms and bacteria are in 
      the water. It is important that you know if the water is pure or not so you don't get poisoned or really sick. You can get 
      sick if the acidic level is too high or too low and if it is to dirty it can also make you sick. 70% of the world is water 
      but 2.5% is fresh. The rest is saline and ocean based. While 2.5% is fresh. It’s important to have clean water because if 
      it’s too dirty you could get really sick or even get waterborne diseases which are really bad for your body. Some examples 
      of waterborne diseases are Cholera, and other serious illnesses such as Guinea Worm Disease,Typhoid, and Dysentery. 
      These types of disease kill millions each year.

Our plan     Our plan is to educate people on sustainable ways to clean rivers and better ways to dispose of their wastewater and solid 
      waste. Our group is creating a website because it is easy to display to people and is accessible to anyone anywhere in 
      the world. This allows us to reach the most people, instead of simply showing it to a few classes and only students at 
      our school people anywhere can see it and share the message of better cleaner water without chemicals or biohazards.

What we Found      We researched different ways of filtering water using water plants and shoreline plants, we found out that many plants 
      have different helpful properties when it comes to filtering and cleaning water. The plants we found were Common 
      water Hyacinth, Golden Cannas,  other Canna Hybrids and Lanceleaf  Frogfruit. These are all plants that grow on 
      the shoreline. All of these plants have been shown to filter water in laboratory and field conditions. These plants filter 
      water by absorbing contaminants such as nitrogen and ammonia. The water Hyacinth can also filter water by creating 
      microorganisms in its roots that cling to floating organic matter making it easier to dissolve. When the plants absorb 
      chemicals and things like nitrogen they make the river cleaner by balancing out the minerals and chemicals in the water. 
      However these plants can not be used alone actual plants would make cleaner water.
      
      <br/>
      <br/>
      
Conclusions      In the end we concluded that the water crisis is quite severe because of the lack of education and good sanitation 
      practices in small African villages. We concluded that there are ways to supplement the water filtration using 
      plants. These plants can naturally filter out some harsh chemicals and floating organic matter. We found out that
      these plants are abundant in other places of the world such as South America. We learned the villagers needed to be
      taught better about wastewater management and treatment. We found out that these plants aren’t perfect and can’t filter
      water completely. We learned that treatment plants are essential to water safety. We learned that pilot projects using 
      plant filtration have already been done in Israel.
